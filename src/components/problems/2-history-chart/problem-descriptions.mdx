# Line chart of last 10 scores of each player

All the scaffolding is in place. Scales are defined and axes are in place. All you have to do is to render a line chart for the top 10 scores of each player.

## Problem 1 

Draw a line chart of the 10 last scores of each player

1. Create a line generator using `d3.line()`
  - Define x and y accessors for the line generator using teh provided scales
  - Use d3.curveMonotoneX to smoothen out the line

2. Use the line generator to draw a line for the scores of each player
  - Use data bidning and data joins to achive this

## Problem 2 

Add animated transitions to the line chart

1. Investigate `selection.attrTween()` and the package `d3-interpolate-path` to animate the lines from one state to another

2. Investigate how to use `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` to animate the lines into view
