# Line chart

All the scaffolding is in place. Scales are defined and axis are in place. All you have to do is to render a line chart for the top 10 scores of each player.

## Problem 1 

Draw a line chart of the 10 last scores of each player

1. Create a line generator using `d3.line()`
  - Define x and y accessors for the line generator using teh provided scales
  - Use d3.curveMonotoneX to smoothen out the line

2. Use the line generator to draw a line for the scores of each player
  - Use data bidning and data joins to achive this

## Problem 2

Add animated transitions to the line chart

1. Investigate how to use `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` to animate a line chart
