# Bar Chart of the top 10 scores

## Problem 1: Define scales

1. Define a linear scale to map scores to positions along the x-axis
  - Take into account the width of the chart and the provided margins
  - The domain should be from 0 to the maximum score in the data
  - Use the `d3.max` function to find the maximum value in the dataset

2. Define a band scale which can map players behind the top 10 scores to positions allong the y-axis
  - Take into account the height of the SVG and the provided margins
  - Derive the domain from the data
  - Pick a suitable value for the inner and outer padding of the band scale.

## Problem 2: Render the X-axis

1. Create an x-axis at the bottom of the chart, using the linear scale for scores you defined in the previous step.

## Problem 3: Render the Y-axis

1. Create a y-axis on the left side of the chart, using the band scale for players you defined in the previous step.
  - The name of the player should be used as labels for the ticks along the axis

## Problem 4: Get the data on the screen

1. Render a rect for each of the top 10 scores using the scales you defined earlier.
  - Apply what we learned about data binding and data joins
  - The width of the rect is calculated by: `scales.x(score)`
  - The x-position of the rect is 0, because of how we defined the scales and transformed the `data-container`-group
  - The height of the rect is calculated by: `scales.y.bandwidth()`
  - The y-position of the rect is calculated by: `scales.y(player.id)`
  - Add color to the rects as you please

  
Extra credit:
  - The fill each rect with a color based on the score. For example: from green (best) to red (worst).

## Problem 5: Adding trasitions

1. Try to reproduce the transitions/animations in the solution (without looking at the code ðŸ™ˆ).

## Problem 6 (extra credit): Add Scores at the end of the bars

1. Render the score of each player at the end of the bar, like in the solution
  - Use `text` elements to add the scores
  - Use the scales to calculate positions
  - Use data binding and data joins like allways ðŸ˜‰
